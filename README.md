### **1. CPA (Cost Per Action)**  
- **What it is:**  
  **CPA** refers to the **Cost per Action** model, where advertisers pay only when a specific action is taken by a user. This could be a purchase, a form submission, or an email sign-up.  
- **Why it’s useful:**  
  CPA is often used when advertisers want to focus on actual conversions (actions) rather than just clicks or impressions. It’s particularly effective for performance-driven campaigns.

### **2. CPM (Cost Per Mille)**  
- **What it is:**  
  **CPM** stands for **Cost per Mille** (with "Mille" being Latin for thousand). In this model, advertisers pay a fixed amount for every 1,000 impressions (views) their ad receives, regardless of whether users click on it.  
- **Why it’s useful:**  
  CPM is great for branding and awareness campaigns where the goal is to reach a large number of people rather than generating immediate actions.

### **3. CPI (Cost Per Install)**  
- **What it is:**  
  **CPI** refers to **Cost per Install**, an advertising model where advertisers pay each time a user installs their app as a result of clicking on an ad.  
- **Why it’s useful:**  
  CPI is often used by mobile app developers to acquire new users. It focuses on generating installs, which is critical for app growth.

---

### **4. CPL (Cost Per Lead)**  
- **What it is:**  
  **CPL** stands for **Cost per Lead**. In this model, advertisers pay for each lead generated, which typically means a user expressing interest in a product or service, such as filling out a contact form or signing up for a newsletter.  
- **Why it’s useful:**  
  CPL is ideal for businesses that want to build a list of potential customers to follow up on, often used in B2B marketing, financial services, and other industries with longer sales cycles.

---

### **5. RTB (Real-Time Bidding)**  
- **What it is:**  
  **RTB** is an auction-based system where advertisers bid in real-time for ad space, typically through ad exchanges. The highest bidder gets their ad shown to the user.  
- **Why it’s useful:**  
  RTB allows for dynamic pricing based on user data and other factors, enabling more efficient use of advertising budgets. It’s widely used in display and video advertising.

---

### **6. CPC (Cost Per Click)**  
- **What it is:**  
  **CPC** refers to **Cost per Click**, where advertisers pay each time a user clicks on their ad.  
- **Why it’s useful:**  
  CPC is ideal when the goal is to drive traffic to a website or landing page, as it’s performance-based. It's popular in search engine advertising (e.g., Google Ads) and can be very effective for campaigns focused on direct response.

---
